Thie is the AR project.
	
	in this project Im going to use OpenCV to program an AR in Python
	at first I thought to use Pygame, but I read on the net about it, and it
	doesnt look that it fit my need for this project and I was reading about
	AR that work great with Java, but since I dont know to program in Java,
	I decided to use my knowledge in Python and use OpenCV

	this is my first project EVER! so, Im so exciting to start progreming in
	Python. my source code will be publish hear for every one.
	for this project I will use toturials from the net
	and my resources is as folloing:
	https://www.python.org/
	http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html
